				<h2>RANGE ROVER EVOQUE</h2>
				<p>Land Rover’s best-selling compact SUV, the Range Rover Evoque, is now even more efficient and digitally connected, with state-of-the-art Pivi infotainment, new efficient petrol and diesel mild-hybrid engines, and unique Special Editions. 
<br>Following the launch of the P300e plug-in hybrids earlier in 2020, a number of additional new engine options are now available for the Range Rover Evoque. Two updated, efficient next-generation four-cylinder Ingenium diesel engines are now available, both featuring Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle (MHEV) technology. Using a belt-driven starter motor and battery pack, vehicles fitted with MHEV technology harvest energy normally lost under deceleration, feeding back to the vehicle’s 48-volt battery. The result is a smoother stop-start operation and optimised fuel economy,  giving customers a taste of the benefits of an electrified vehicle without needing to plug in and charge. Available in 165PS and 200PS outputs, these are more powerful and efficient than the engines they replace, with CO2 from 158g/km and fuel economy of up to 46.7mpg for the New Range Rover Evoque.</p>

				<h2>RANGE ROVER SPORT</h2>
				<p>The Land Rover Range Rover Sport, generally known simply as the Range Rover Sport, is a mid-size luxury SUV produced under their Land Rover marque, from the British manufacturer Land Rover, and later Jaguar Land Rover. The first generation (codename: L320) started production in 2005, and was replaced by the second generation Sport.
<br> The Range Rover Sport was prefigured by the Range Stormer concept car, introduced at the 2004 North American International Auto Show. This was a low-slung, short wheelbase 3-door coupé that was unusually "sporty" in the context of Land Rover's history.[2] Designed by Richard Woolley, the marque's first complete concept car sported split-folding gullwing doors, one-piece skeletal seats, a "clamshell" bonnet, 22 inch alloys, a 289 km/h (180 mph) top speed, 4WD and a 2,500 kg (5,512 lb) weight. The Range Rover Sport was comparably of much more conservative design featuring five doors and a wheelbase hardly shorter than that of the Range Rover Vogue. </p>

				<h2>RANGE ROVER VELAR</h2>
				<p>The Range Rover Velar ushers in a new design language for Land Rover that is influenced by Land Rover's previous design language that began with the Evoque and most recently was used in the Range Rover Sport. The new design language features smoother lines on the body, and emphasises sportiness and on-road ability, but more important is the new interior design language that begins with the Velar, which will later spread to other Range Rover models. The interior of the Velar is influenced by that of the I-Pace of 2018 and features 3 touchscreens, which control most of the interior features of the Velar. The cockpit of the Velar is more driver-focused[weasel words] and the seating position is lower than any other Land Rover before, as sportiness and on-road performance are top priorities. </p>
